## 📄 Description
TripNChill is a dynamic and responsive travel booking website designed to streamline the process of planning and reserving trips online. 
The platform offers users a simple interface to enter their travel details including departure location, destination, dates, number of

notification system powered by PHPMailer. Upon confirmation, customers receive a personalized email with full trip details, enhancing 
the communication and professionalism of the service. Built using core web technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, this project
